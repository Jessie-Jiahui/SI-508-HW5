You should add a README.md file to your GitHub repository in a clear, outline format that will make it easy for someone else to understand what functionality the code has, clone the code, and use it. Consider the README you'd want to get if you were interested in this code but did not have a lot of time. This does NOT have to be long -- but should include 

a bulletpoint list of things you can do with with this code 
at least a title header.
