# SI508 Homework5
#### This code is based on ideas about decks of "standard 52-deck" playing cards. You can read more about them, if you are unfamiliar, here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck. I am supposed to write tests to ensure that all of these things in the description that CAN and SHOULD be tested are indeed working as they should. I should write those tests in the file SI508_assignment5_tests.py, including at least 12 test methods. 

## Getting Started
#### This code is written with Python3. You can get view it directly on the Github webpage or make a copy by folking the project and running on youryou should create a GitHub account and downloaded Git properly. 

## Key Files Within
#### INSTRUCTIONS_SI508_HW5.txt is a file that provides the overal instructions about this assignment.
#### code_description_SI508_assignment5.txt includes a description of what a bunch of code ought to do. This is the file I rely on for writing the test code.
#### That code being described is saved in the file SI508_cards.py. However, there are at least 3 bugs in the code so that it does not do what the description says it should do.
#### SI508_assignment5_tests.py saved the test code I wrote in, which will test the performance of file SI508_cards.py.

## About Test
#### I wrote 23 different test methods within 3 classes correpsonding to class Card, class Deck, and function play_war_game. They will function to test unusual cases of the code in the file SI508_cards.py, based on the description.
